          <h2>Overfishing</h2>
          <p>
            Many of the fish we see in restaurants or grocery stores—like tuna, cod, and salmon—are at risk of disappearing due to overfishing. When too many fish are caught too quickly, populations can't bounce back, and the entire ocean food chain is disrupted. By choosing sustainably caught seafood and supporting conservation efforts, we can help protect marine life for future generations.

          <h2>Reef-Safe Sunscreen</h2>
          <p>
            Did you know that some sunscreen ingredients that protect your skin can harm coral reefs? Chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate can bleach and damage coral, even in small amounts. Reef-safe sunscreen avoids these harmful ingredients, making it a smarter, safer choice for you and marine life.

          <h2>Coral Bleaching</h2>
          <p>
            Coral reefs are often called the "rainforests of the sea" because they support such a huge variety of marine life. Unfortunately, they are in danger from pollution, warming oceans, and destructive human activity. When coral reefs die, fish and other animals lose their homes.

          <p>
            Ghost nets—lost or abandoned fishing gear—trap marine life and contribute to massive trash islands. Groups around the world work to remove this debris and prevent further pollution in our oceans.
