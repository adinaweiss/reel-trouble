            Many of the fish we see in restaurants or grocery stores like tuna, cod, and 
            salmon are at risk of disappearing due to overfishing. When too many fish are 
            caught too quickly, populations can't bounce back, and the entire ocean food 
            chain is disrupted. By choosing sustainably caught seafood and supporting 
            conservation efforts, we can help protect marine life for future generations. 
            Organizations around the world are working to protect fish populations through 
            education, policy change, and sustainable fishing methods.

            Did you know that some of the sunscreen ingredients that protect your skin can 
            actually harm coral reefs? Chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate can bleach 
            and damage coral, even in small amounts. Reef-safe sunscreen avoids these harmful 
            ingredients, making it a smarter, safer choice for you and marine life. Making 
            the switch is easy, and it's one of the simplest ways families can help protect 
            ocean ecosystems while enjoying time at the beach.

            Coral reefs are often called the "rainforests of the sea" because they support 
            such a huge variety of marine life. Unfortunately, they are in danger from 
            pollution, warming oceans, and destructive human activity. When coral reefs die, 
            fish and other animals lose their homes. People of all ages can help protect 
            reefs by using eco-friendly products, reducing plastic use, and 
            learning about ocean-friendly habits.

            The Ocean Cleanup has removed over 50 million pounds of trash from the ocean. 
            Not only do they clean the ocean, they also innovate technologies to aid in the 
            removal of trash from rivers and the sea. In 2021, they partnered with MrBeast's 
            TeamSeas campaign, which removed over 34 million pounds of trash from the ocean. 
            Their mission is to rid the world's oceans of all plastic pollution.

            Every year, thousands of marine animals are injured or killed by ghost netsâ€”fishing 
            gear that has been lost or discarded in the ocean. These nets can drift for years, 
            trapping fish, turtles, and even whales. Along with floating trash islands made of 
            plastic waste, ghost nets are one of the ocean's biggest threats. Many groups are 
            now working to remove debris and prevent more waste from entering the ocean.
